\description{
Loads a graph from file into an igraph graph object and does the following 
to make the graph compatible with the ORCA fast orbit calculation package:
  1. Makes the graph undirected
  2. Removes loops (where both endpoints of an edge are the same vertex)
  3. Removes multiple edges (i.e. ensuring only one edge exists for each 
     pair of endpoints)
  4. Removes isolated vertices (i.e. vertices with no edges after the 
     previous alterations)
