\title{Ego-network graphlet counts}
\usage{
count_graphlets_ego(graph, max_graphlet_size = 4, neighbourhood_size)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{A connected, undirected, simple graph as an \code{igraph} object.}

\item{max_graphlet_size}{Determines the maximum size of graphlets to count. 
Only graphlets containing up to \code{max_graphlet_size} nodes will be counted.}

\item{neighbourhood_size}{The number of steps from the source node to include
node in ego-network.}
}
\value{
ORCA-format matrix containing counts of each graphlet (columns) for 
the n-step ego-network for each vertex in the graph (rows).
}
\description{
Calculates graphlet counts for the n-step ego-network of each node in a graph
}
