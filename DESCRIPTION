Description: An implementation of the NetEMD alignment-free network
    distance measure. The NetEMD measure is the minimal earth-mover's distance
    between the graph feature distribution for two networks.
    The package includes methods to calculate graphlet degree feature
    distributions for graphlets of up to 5 nodes, or you can provide your own
    feature distributions. The package accepts graphs in igraph format.
